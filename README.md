# About the project

This site was developed as part of a front-end exam at ITS INCOM in Milan, Italy, in collaboration with other colleagues. My specific contribution was focused on creating the shopping cart page and functionality for the website. Through this project, we aimed to showcase our skills in web development and provide a seamless user experience.
